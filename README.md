# Network-Traffic-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
The "Network Traffic Classification Algorithms" project focuses on classifying network traffic using machine learning techniques, specifically K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest algorithms. Network traffic classification is essential for monitoring, security, and optimizing network performance. The project involves preprocessing network traffic data, extracting relevant features, and training models to categorize traffic into different types, such as normal or malicious. KNN, a distance-based algorithm, helps classify data based on similarity, while Random Forest, an ensemble learning method, improves accuracy by combining multiple decision trees
The dataset use in this project
File DataPreprocessing.ipynb implements the preparation of data for use in machine learning algorithms.
In KNN and RandomForest there are application of algorithms to classify network traffic. Those algorithms were used on preprocessed CSV file created in the previous step.
